# Web-Dev-Practise
The Repository contains various files that I have made during the practise of HTML, CSS and Javasvript.
Through the buttons.html and buttons.css file as well as the Text-Practice and Website files, I have learnt the basic features and format of HTML and CSS features.
Through the Dummy-Youtube Site, I have learn the fundamentals of containers such as div and flexbox and their features. I also learnt various things they offer for styling the website and aligning the icons as well as the images and text in different layouts and taught me how can I create any webpage that looks exactly like a selected original webpage.
The 3 files named tc are to make a temperature convertor webpage(basically a form) using javascript basics.
